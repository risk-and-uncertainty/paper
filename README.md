# Risk and Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning

Code associated with our paper "Estimating Risk and Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning"

# Requirements

Requirements can be found in the requirements.txt file.

# Structure

The project contains one folder per experiment in the paper, except for Atari experiments that are all within the Atari folder. Most folders contain a jupyter notebook that can be used to reproduce the corresponding experiment, except for Bandits and Atari where the associated computation cost is quite large. Each folder contains its own README.
